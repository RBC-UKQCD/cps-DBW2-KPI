CPS version 5.0.16 with some modification by Luchang

CPS version greg_MADWF_CJ.

Build and install CPS along with all its dependencies.
$ ./build.sh

or optionally on DD2 to compile DD1 version

$ host=DD1 cps=~/cps-jlc-dd1 ./build.sh

Just build CPS. (Require all its dependencies has been installed)
$ ./scripts/cps.sh

Works well on BGQ. On Qcdserver, one need to install openmpi.
To build on cuth, one need to compile a newer version of GCC.
