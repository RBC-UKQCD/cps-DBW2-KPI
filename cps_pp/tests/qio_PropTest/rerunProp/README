Loads a gauge configuration and a propagator (filename of prop. defined in qpropw_arg.vml) and rerun the calculation. Result is compared to propagator from file.

Use the same qpropw_arg.vml as used for the generation should guarantee success.
(If you want to see some error: use a different mass value then used for the original propagator in qpropw_arg.vml, you should then see lines like:

mismatch propagator: index 15 snk 3 2 src 3 2
  37.282887: (-0.003016,0.003857) <-> (-0.002503,0.003857)

first number: rel. difference, followed by the two compared complex numbers

and finally:
 QPropWPointSrc::Run():  ReRun prop. with TOTAL NUMBER OF ERRORS: 147456.000000
)


Using the provided do_arg.vml on a motherboard should work with:


qpartition_remap -T045 -Y1  -Z2 -X3 

qrun QCDOC.x $PWD do_arg.vml evo_arg.vml qpropw_arg.vml 0 randomlattice.IEEE64BIG 1e-5

The general syntax is:

x.x DIR DO_ARG EVO_ARG QPROPW_ARG GAUGETYPE LATTICEIN [ PREC ] 

where:

DIR: directory, where the code is executed

GAUGETYPE: 	0: reading in NERSC-format
		1: reading in QIO-format

LATTICEIN: name of gaugeconfig

PREC (opt): precision for comparing propagators
