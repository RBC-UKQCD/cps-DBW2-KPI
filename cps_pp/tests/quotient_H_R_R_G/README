2/8/06  RDM

This test uses a 4 timescale evolution, with
HMC, RHMC, RHMC and gauge steps in order from coarsest
to finest timescales.  The coarsest RHMC is controlled
by rat_quo0_arg.vml and the finest by rat_quo1_arg.vml

The .vml files here were used with quotient.C on a
2k QCDOC partition to evolve a 24^3 x 64 x 16 lattice
