\section{Overall aims}
The CPS code structure and build system aims to:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.0cm}
 \item Use standard GNU filenames, extensions, directory structures, and
 compile using standard UNIX/GNU tools.
 \item Reflect the structure of the object-oriented code in the structure of
 the source directory tree.
 \item Allow sources, libraries and binaries for different platforms to coexist.
 \item Build all libraries relevant to a given platform, so that the specific
 implementation can be chosen at link time.
\item Maintain Compatibility with the current QCDSP hardware and development environment.
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{The Directory Structure}
\label{sec:dirs}

%----------------------------------------
\subsection{The top-level of the tree}
All files are held in a directory called \emph{cps/}, for the Columbia Physics System.
The directory structure at this uppermost level reflects standard GNU practice
for organising software distributions.

\subsubsection{Files}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.0cm}
 \item \emph{cps/Makefile}
 \item \emph{cps/configure}
 \item \emph{cps/README}
 \item \emph{cps/INSTALL}
 \item \emph{cps/...etc...}
\end{itemize}
The autoconf-based configure script, the overall makefile and other top-level 
files are examined further in section \ref{sec:build} below.

\subsubsection{Directories}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.0cm}
 \item \emph{cps/src/} - Directory containing the source tree.
 \item \emph{cps/include/} - Directory containing the source header files.
 \item \emph{cps/lib/} - Directory holding the binary library files for a given platform.
 \item \emph{cps/docs/} - The documentation directory.
 \item \emph{cps/test/} - The test suite (see section \ref{sec:tests}).
\end{itemize}

We consider each directory in turn.

%----------------------------------------
\subsection{The Source Tree: \emph{cps/src/...}}
There are three design criteria for the organisation of the source tree:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.0cm}
\item The top-level of the source tree should reflect logically separable
classes of code.
\item The deeper directory structure should accurately reflect the
object-oriented structure of the code.
\item The final leaves of the directory-tree should effectively separate code
for different platforms, so that the source files for a particular platform can be
easily identified.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The top-level of the source tree}
The source directory in this version of the code corresponds to a combination of the 
source files from \emph{phys/[util,alg,nga,task,mem]}.  The original layout
was driven by the target platform, whereas the new layout moves the
platform-dependencies further down the tree. However on Consultation with 
Bob, we decided to keep the original \emph{util, alg, nga, task, mem}
layout to separate cleanly the functions in these directories. The 
functions outlined by Bob are:
\begin{description}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.0cm}
 \item{\emph{util}} -- These are physics related utilities, to do with
lattices, Dirac Operators, Vectors, linear algebra and the like.
 \item{\emph{alg}} -- The classes herein correspond to algorithms to 
perform measurements, such as quark propagators, $\bar{\psi}\psi$ etc.
 \item{\emph{task}} -- The original intention here was to have combinations
of \emph{alg} classes to perform more complicated tasks, such as a Hybrid Monte Calro, with inline measurements and so forth, including running scripts. However, the original development ``ran out of energy'' and so this directory is 
somewhat disorganised.
 \item{\emph{nga}} -- This directory contains routines to perform various 
kinds of communications (NGA stands for Node Gate Array -- the communications hardware of the QCDSP). It is envisaged that we rename this to something like \emph{comms}.
 \item{\emph{mem}} -- This directory contained code to deal with loading 
data in and out of internal memory of the DSP chips on QCDSP. It is highly
likely that future machines, may need similar routines, for example the 
QCDOC will have some EDRAM that may need to be accessed through specialised
routines.
\end{description}

Bearing in mind our consultation by video conference on Aug 20, 2002,
the suggested code structure at this level is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.0cm}
 \item \emph{cps/src/alg/} - Directory containing the Alg class.
 \item \emph{cps/src/comms/} - The comms routines.
 \item \emph{cps/src/comms/gsum/} - The global sum routines.
 \item \emph{cps/src/io/} - I/O routines.
 \item \emph{cps/src/io/qcdio} -- The currend QCDIO library
 \item \emph{cps/src/mem} - Routines for managing internal memories
 \item \emph{cps/src/task/} - Directory containing the tasks.
 \item \emph{cps/src/util/DiracOp/} - Directory containing the DiracOp class.
 \item \emph{cps/src/util/Error/} - Directory containing the Error class.
 \item \emph{cps/src/util/GlobalJobParameter/} - Directory containing the GlobalJobParameter class.
 \item \emph{cps/src/util/lapack/} - The lapack linear algebra routines.
 \item \emph{cps/src/util/Lattice/} - Directory containing the Lattice class.
 \item \emph{cps/src/util/Mom/} - Directory containing the Mom class.
 \item \emph{cps/src/util/pmalloc/} - The pmalloc routines.
 \item \emph{cps/src/util/Random/} - Directory containing the Random class.
 \item \emph{cps/src/util/RComplex/} - Directory containing the RComplex class.
 \item \emph{cps/src/util/RFloat/} - Directory containing the RFloat class.
 \item \emph{cps/src/util/smalloc/} - The smalloc routines.
 \item \emph{cps/src/util/Vector/} - Directory containing the Vector class.
 \item \emph{cps/src/util/Verbose/} - Directory containing the Verbose class.
\end{itemize}

Here we have added an \emph{io} directory which is expected to contain
functions for loading and saving configurations, propagators and the like.

In ``leaf'' directories, upper-case names indicate a corresponding class exists
(i.e. the class DiracOp is defined in DiracOp.C in
\emph{cps/src/DiracOp}).  Lowercase directory names indicate that this
directory contains utility functions that are not wrapped in C++
classes.

It has been agreed in the videoconference that leaf directories 
and library names should follow the names of the classes (ie libDiracOp.a,
on UNIX and DiracOp.olb on QCDSP). After some testing it appears that
the Compiler/Linker/Archiver toolchains can deal with this naming 
convention on QCDSP (Tartan), Solaris (cc/CC), AIX (xlc) and Linux
(gcc). Hence this naming scheme will be adopted in the new code structure.

There exist currently some functions that are not wrapped in C++ classes,
in the short term it is acceptable to put these in a \emph{cps/src/notCPP}
directory, but in the long term such a directory ought to be eliminated. 
Insofar as the pure C / Assembler functions are related to a C++ class, 
they should reside in the same directory as that class.
separate \emph{cps/src/misc/} directory?

\query{Should pmalloc and smalloc be combined into one ``memory'' directory,
including all from \emph{phys/mem/}.}

\subsubsection{The deeper directory structure}
This should reflect the OO structure.  So, if we look at the Doxygen
documentation \\
(see \href{http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/~ukqcd/cps/}{http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/\~{}ukqcd/cps/} ) \\
for a given class, e.g. the Dirac Operators:\\
\href{http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/~ukqcd/cps/doxygen/html/class_DiracOp.html}{http://www.epcc.ed.ac.uk/\~{}ukqcd/cps/doxygen/html/class\_DiracOp.html}

This suggests the following structure:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.0cm}
 \item \emph{cps/src/DiracOp/} 
 \item \emph{cps/src/DiracOp/DiracOpStagTypes/} 
 \item \emph{cps/src/DiracOp/DiracOpStagTypes/DiracOpStag/}
 \item \emph{cps/src/DiracOp/DiracOpWilsonTypes/}
 \item \emph{cps/src/DiracOp/DiracOpWilsonTypes/DiracOpClover/}
 \item \emph{cps/src/DiracOp/DiracOpWilsonTypes/DiracOpDwf/}
 \item \emph{cps/src/DiracOp/DiracOpWilsonTypes/DiracOpWilson/}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Separating code for different platforms}
\label{sssec:sepcode}
File common to all platforms are held in the object's directory.  e.g. The
pure-C++ file that defines the abstract base class \cde{DiracOp} is held in
\emph{cps/src/DiracOp/DiracOp.C}.  Any platform dependent files are stored in
further subdirectories:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.0cm}
 \item \emph{cps/src/DiracOp/} - Source common to all platforms. 
 \item \emph{cps/src/DiracOp/noarch/} - Portable versions of usually
 platform-dependent code. 
 \item \emph{cps/src/DiracOp/qcdsp/} - QCDSP-only files.
 \item \emph{cps/src/DiracOp/qcdoc/} - QCDOC-only files.
 \item \emph{cps/src/DiracOp/alpha/} - Alpha-chipset-only files.
 \item \emph{cps/src/DiracOp/x86linux/} - (x86 chip-series, Linux OS)-only files.
\end{itemize}

In some cases, for a given platform, multiple implementations of the same
functionality are present.  For example, there are a large number of
QCDSP-specific global sum routines and Dirac operation routines that fulfill
the same function.   Each of these will be held in a separate directory within
the \emph{.../qcdsp/} directory and each will be compiled into a separate
library using the name of the directory as the library name.  e.g.

\emph{phys/util/dirac\_op/d\_op\_wilson\_opt\_lcl\_nos/}

becomes

\emph{cps/src/DiracOp/DiracOpWilsonTypes/DiracOpWilson/qcdsp/d\_op\_wilson\_opt\_lcl\_nos/}

and (on QCDSP only) will result in a library file called 

\emph{cps/lib/libd\_op\_wilson\_opt\_lcl\_nos.a}, 

sitting alongside the more general 

\emph{cps/lib/libDiracOp.a}.

There is a large amount of code replication in the global sum and Dirac
operator directories. It is not expected that such a large number of 
classes / libraries will exist in general. The current strategy is 
to put all the sources and libraries into a machine specific \\
\emph{cps/src/DiracOp/DiracOpWilsonTypes/DiracOpWilson/qcdsp} directory and build them 
all as is done currently. A second pass may then try and eliminate the
replication of codes.


%----------------------------------------
\subsection{The Include Files: \emph{cps/include/...}}

The current code structure has separated include files to reside 
relatively close to the source files:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.0cm}
\item \emph{phys/util/include} -- Include files for the sources in \emph{util}
\item \emph{phys/alg/include} -- Include files for the sources in \emph{alg}
\item \emph{phys/mem/include} -- Include files for the sources in \emph{mem}
\item \emph{phys/nga/include} -- Include files for the sources in \emph{nga}
\end{itemize}

It is intended to reorganise these, into one single include directory.
To prevent undue flattaning of the current structure and mixing of names
we envisage keeping the current distinctions within this include directory
as in:

\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{0.0cm}
\item \emph{cps/include/util} -- Include files for the sources in \emph{util}
\item \emph{cps/include/alg} -- Include files for the sources in \emph{alg}
\item \emph{cps/include/mem} -- Include files for the sources in \emph{mem}
\item \emph{cps/include/comms} -- Include files for the sources in \emph{comms}
-- the new name for the \emph{nga} directory.
\end{itemize}

This has the advantage of maintaining current distinctions. A user can then 
set his ``include path'' to \emph{cps/include}, and include files with 
directives such as \#include $<$util/lattice.h$>$ and so forth. Alternatively,
several include paths can be set (for the GNU compiler:\emph{ -Icps/include/util -Icps/include/alg/mem -Icps/include/comms}) in which case one can include
headers in sources with directives such as \#include$<$lattice.h$>$.

\query{Which of the above two are preferred?}

%----------------------------------------
\subsection{The Library Files: \emph{cps/lib/...}}
All the library files, one for each of the main directories in \emph{cps/src/}
plus ones for platform-dependent variants of a given library (as described at
the end of section \ref{sssec:sepcode}).

%----------------------------------------
\subsection{The Documentation: \emph{cps/docs/...}}
This is essentially the same as in the original EPCC-Columbia distribution,
with HTML as the primary format, and including the Doxygen-ized version of the
code.

%----------------------------------------
\subsection{The Test Suite: \emph{cps/test/...}}
At first, this will be a copy of the original CPS test suite, or at
least the parts of that suite that work on all platforms.  

Eventually a more general test suite must be defined and implemented, taking
advantage of the new hypercubic RNG implemented at Columbia.


%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{The Build System}
\label{sec:build}
The build strategy is simple.  We use a {\tt{configure;make;make install}}
scheme, where the install can be made to separate binaries for different
platforms.  For any given target platform, we make every library that is relevant 
to that platform.  The only compilation option that cannot be separated out
into a separate library is the decision whether to use float or double
precision floating-point arithmetic.  Broadly:

\begin{verbatim}
%./configure --target=[TARGET]  \
             --prefix=/cps/[TARGET]/  \
             --enable-double-precision=[yes|no]
%make
%make install
\end{verbatim}

The parallel/serial and other platform-specific options are chosen at the link
stage, the tests do this and thus require a separate configure+make system.

{\tt{make install}} will make and populate a directory called (generically)
instdir, by creating the following structure
\begin{itemize}
 \item \emph{instdir/}
 \begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{arch/}
  \begin{itemize}
   \item \emph{include/} copy of include directory.
   \item \emph{lib/} all libs for target.
   \item \emph{doc/} documents.
   \begin{itemize}
    \item \emph{doxygen/} doxygened docs, for source used in build.
   \end{itemize}
   \item \emph{bin/} executables created by build.
   \item \emph{src/} a copy of the sources used in this build.
  \end{itemize}
 \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
  
instdir would be specified as usual by the --prefix option to configure.  Note
that arch/ may be superfluous, as may bin/ the bin is suggested by the facts
that there would always be some stock executables that would be built (e.g. the
test ones)


%----------------------------------------
\subsection{Makefile Rules}
It is envisaged that there would be some file called Makefile.rules say, that
encapsulates the rules for building the particular application. This would
live in the top-level source directory.  The rules could contain:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Invocations for the compiler, archiver, assembler etc.
 \item Various compiler and assembler flags (include paths, preprocessing options such as -DHAVE\_CONFIG).
 \item Definitions of suffixes and rules for building object files, e.g. from C++ and from assembler files.
\end{itemize}

Makefile rules could be either pre-written for specific systems, e.g.
Makefile.rules.alpha Makefile.rules.sparc or could have their values filled in
by autoconf, or perhaps be generated through some combination. (e.g.: Autoconf
fills in path information and optimisation flags, whereas the rest are pre
written) (Makefile.rules.alpha.in...)

In subdirectories, one would use recursive files, just like the current QCDSP
build system (using the more portable GNU make). The leaf makefiles
could all include the top-level rules file. The leaf makefiles would presumably
work on some wildcard mechanism (i.e. compile all .C and .S files in the current
directory).  Library names would be specified by base names of current
directory.

Working out how to traverse the right set of directories for a particular
architecture, is a problem to be solved by us. Our goals in this direction 
are that the build system be as simple as possible, for future maintenance.

As a final statement, we need to describe why building the executables is
harder than to build the library. We don't know what mode of operation is
expected as there are so many options:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Should we run with no safety (nos)?
 \item Should we run with dirac\_opt\_stag or dirac\_opt\_stag\_rdm?
 \item Should we run a parallel build with a simulated SCU?
 \item Should we run with QMP?
 \item ...
\end{itemize}
One way around this would be to have independent makefiles for the executables
(for the most common targets) that could include the rules from the first
level configuration -- this punts the issue of what options we need to pass to
autoconf, and may fit well into the current testing framework. The list of
builds is relatively easy (already exists on QCDSP -- and doesn't really exist
in a crystallised form for other targets). One possibility is to have a
test/qcdsp test/alpha etc etc directories where we could have the different
architectural tests (e.g. tests that exercise hardware like SCUs and so worth)
another possibility is to have a single directory of test cases with makefiles
for all architectures in them (the top-level rules would be used for building,
but the library lists would need to be hardwired depending on the test in
question.)  I lean towards the first option myself. We should discuss with
Chris Miller how this fits into his testing environment. Similar setup could
be used to build stock applications (hmc, etc etc)

An alternative scheme for building the executables has been suggested by
Craig McNeile, which would involve having some generic GUI interface,
through which users can choose the particular library versions they desire.
This has the advantage, that the choice of libraries for a particular
architecture can be ``institutionalised''. Whether such a GUI is to be 
a C++ program, Tcl/Tk script, Jave applet or a web form is yet open to debate.

{\bf It is not in the remit of this particular reorganisation to decide on, 
or implement this strategy. Our current brief is to make sure that the libraries can be built and installed}.

%----------------------------------------
\subsection{External Libraries}
Somehow we need to tell the compiler about where these live (e.g.
--with-mpi=/usr/mpich, or --with-mpi-include=/usr/mpich/include -- so that the
right include files can be found -- for the libraries only the include files
matter. However for the executables obviously the libraries are needed too.

What would be classed as an external library?
\begin{itemize}
 \item \emph{MPI} (for sure)
 \item \emph{GM} (on clusters say)
 \item \emph{QMP}  (default no -- could be based on MPI or SCU or implemented directly...)
 \item \emph{SCU}  (default no -- too ingrained in the code)
\end{itemize}


%-------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{The Test Suite}
\label{sec:tests}
This will require a complex configure script to allow the user to choose
between the different possible libraries available for a given platform.
However, for a general platform, the core option is whether to run in serial
or in parallel.
