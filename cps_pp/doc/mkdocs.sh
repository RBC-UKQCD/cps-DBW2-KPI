# Runs doxygen to produce the reference manual and the user guide and 
# installdox to get the cross-references right.

# This script is really meant to be called from Makefile_cps and so the
# CPS directory structure is assumed e.g. the ref and usr directories 
# and the source are in all the right places.
# However it can still be useful to use
# this as a stand-alone script. The bottom line is that this script expects 
# to be called from its own directory or its parent directory.
