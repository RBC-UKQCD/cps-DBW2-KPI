<TITLE> How to mirror the cps++ code  </TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor = "white">

Currently the main CVS repository for the cps++
code is at Edinburgh on the trumpton linux box.
The Columbia group wanted a copy on their machines.
Also we needed to be able to backup the CVS
repository.
<p>

The 
<a href="http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/">rsync</a>
command can be used to back up a directory.
<P>
<pre>
setenv RSYNC_RSH ssh
mkdir CVS
rsync -avz trumpton.ph.ed.ac.uk:/Disk/ukqcd/QCDOC/CVS/cps++  CVS
rsync -avz trumpton.ph.ed.ac.uk:/Disk/ukqcd/QCDOC/CVS/CVSROOT  CVS
</pre>

<p>
To check the code out of the mirrored CVS directory:
<pre>
 cvs -d/home/mcneile/mirror/CVS/ co cps++
</pre>
where /home/mcneile/mirror/CVS/ should be replaced by the
full path length of your mirrored CVS directory.
<p>
<font color="red" >Please don't use this system to make changes to the mirrored CVS
directory. </font> This system is purely for backup.  There are
systems that allow multiple CVS repositories, but they are
more complicated.


<h1> Other options to mirror cps++ </h1>

There are some more powerful ways of maintaining multiple
CVS directories. The <a href="http://www.cvsup.org/">cvsup</a>
utility creates a copy of CVS repository. Only one copy can be
used to easily check in code.
The <a href="http://www.elegosoft.com/dcvs/">DCVS</a>
does allow bidirectional updating of multiple repositories.
DCVS does not look easy to install.
There is also a standard unix utility called
<a href="http://www.magnicomp.com/rdist/">rdist</a> for
copying files to many machines.
